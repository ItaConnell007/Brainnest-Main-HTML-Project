            <h3>Icing on the Cake</h3>
            One of the most memorable scenes in the movie is when Mrs. Doubtfire frantically smashes her face in a cake
            to
            disguise herself.

            <p> The icing drips into Mrs. Sellner’s tea and she says, “There you go, you’ve got your cream and your
                sugar now.”
                This hilarious detail was actually completely unintentional. </p>

            <p> Because it was so hot on set, the icing dripped from Robin Williams’ chin and he just improvised from
                there.</p>
