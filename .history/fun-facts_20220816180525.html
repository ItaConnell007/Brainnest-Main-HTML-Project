    <h1> Fun Facts about Mrs Doubtfire Movie</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>

            <h3>Icing on the Cake</h3>
            One of the most memorable scenes in the movie is when Mrs. Doubtfire frantically smashes her face in a cake
            to
            disguise herself.

            <p> The icing drips into Mrs. Sellner’s tea and she says, “There you go, you’ve got your cream and your
                sugar now.”
                This hilarious detail was actually completely unintentional. </p>

            <p> Because it was so hot on set, the icing dripped from Robin Williams’ chin and he just improvised from
                there.</p>

            <h3>Oh Dear</h3>
            <p>Listen closely and you’ll hear Mrs. Doubtfire say the word “dear” a whopping 101 times throughout the
                film.</p>

            <h3>Home Sweet Home</h3>
            <p>The home address you hear Miranda Hillard give Mrs. Doubtfire on the phone is the real address of the
                house used to film the movie: 2640 Steiner St.</p>
