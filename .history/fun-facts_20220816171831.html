    <h1> Fun Facts about Mrs Doubtfire Movie</h1>

    <p>24. Icing on the Cake
        One of the most memorable scenes in the movie is when Mrs. Doubtfire frantically smashes her face in a cake to disguise herself. The icing drips into Mrs. Sellner’s tea and she says, “There you go, you’ve got your cream and your sugar now.” This hilarious detail was actually completely unintentional. </p>
        <p>  Because it was so hot on set, the icing dripped from Robin Williams’ chin and he just improvised from there.</p>
