    <h1>Mrs Doubtfire</h1>

    <h2>Storyline</h2>
    <p>
        Troubled that he has little access to his children, divorced Daniel
        Hillard (Robin Williams) hatches an elaborate plan.
    </p>
    <p>
        With help from his creative brother Frank (Harvey Fierstein), he dresses
        as an older British woman and convinces his ex-wife, Miranda (Sally
        Field), to hire him as a nanny.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Mrs. Doubtfire" wins over the children and helps Daniel become a better
        parent -- but when both Daniel and his nanny persona must meet different
        parties at the same restaurant, his secrets may be exposed.
    </p>
